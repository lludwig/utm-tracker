== Upgrade Notice ==

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What happens if someone visits a bunch of pages on my website/blog before filling the form?

It doesn't matter. As soon as they land on your website, the script saves the information in a cookie. This cookie is valid for 30 days. It adds this information automatically to your form from the saved cookie.

=Where can I find more about UTM parameters and how to properly use them?

I recommend reading [this tutorial](https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-use-utm-parameters/) on using UTM parameters, standardizing the naming and tracking them.
